    <h2>Description</h2>
    This strikingly delicious pumpkin-black cocoa swirl Bundt cake packs a
    flavor punch thanks to black cocoa. Not only does it make for a wonderfully
    dark color, but it also adds a flavor reminiscent of Oreo cookies!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>cooking spray with flour, such as Baker's Joy®</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
      <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 (15-ounce can) pumpkin puree (not pumpkin pie filling)</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 cup sour cream, at room temperature</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 12-cup Bundt pan with a baking spray
        containing flour, such as Baker's Joy®.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large bowl, sift together flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder,
        baking soda, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another large bowl, beat butter, oil, and 2 cups white sugar on
        medium-high speed with an electric mixer until creamy, about 3 minutes.
        Add in eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. After adding
        in the last egg, beat mixture on medium-high speed until doubled in
        volume, about 5 minutes. Add in pumpkin and vanilla, and mix until
        incorporated. Reduce mixer speed to low; pour in half of dry
        ingredients, and mix until just combined. Add in sour cream; mix until
        just combined. Add in remaining dry ingredients and mix until just
        combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Measure out 3 cups batter into another bowl. To this 3 cups batter, add
        3 tablespoon black cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons
        sugar, milk, espresso powder, and melted semi-sweet chocolate. Mix on
        low speed until combined.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place 1/3 of black cocoa batter into an even layer in the bottom of the
        prepared Bundt pan. Pour 1/2 of plain pumpkin batter over the black
        cocoa layer. Add another 1/3 of black cocoa batter over the top of plain
        pumpkin batter. Layer remaining 1/2 of plain pumpkin batter over that.
        Finish with remaining 1/3 of the black cocoa batter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake cake in the preheated oven until a bamboo skewer inserted into the
        center of the cake comes out mostly clean, 60 to 65 minutes. Allow cake
        to cool in pan 25 to 30 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to
        cool completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        To make icing, place powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons black cocoa, 1
        teaspoon vanilla extract, pinch of salt, and heavy cream into a bowl.
        Whisk until smooth. Drizzle icing over cooled cake.
      </li>
    </ol>
